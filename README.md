# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Dataset

The dataset typically used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).
